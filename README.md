# GuiCalculator

Implemented a graphical application for basic operations with integers: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.

In the upper part of the application window there is one text field for entering a mathematical expression. Buttons for entering numbers and mathematical operations are located at the bottom. The interface scales freely depending on the size of the window itself.

If non-specific information is entered or the expression cannot be executed, the text "ERROR" is written in the field.
